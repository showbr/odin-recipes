        <h2>Description:</h2>
        <p>Pé de Moleque peanut candy combines caramelized sugar with roasted peanuts for a rich, nutty, and perfectly crunchy, nostalgic Brazilian treat.</p>
        
        <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Granulated sugar</li>
            <li>Water</li>
            <li>Roasted peanuts (unsalted and skinless)</li>
            <li>Butter</li>
            <li>Sweetened condensed milk (optional, for a softer texture)</li>
            <li>Pinch of salt</li>
            <li>Baking soda</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Step by step</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Spread the peanuts in a single layer on a baking sheet and roast for about 5-7 minutes, or until they're lightly golden and fragrant. This brings out the natural oils and enhances the nutty flavor. Let them cool before using.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, grease a baking sheet or flat surface with butter and set it aside—this is where the candy will set, so make sure it's ready.</li>
            <li>In a heavy-bottomed saucepan, combine the sugar and water over medium-high heat. Stir occasionally until the sugar completely dissolves, and the mixture starts to bubble gently (around 3-5 minutes).</li>
            <li>Let the sugar mixture continue to simmer without stirring until it turns a warm golden color (the right temperature is between 320-330°F with a candy thermometer). Keep an eye on it here, the sugar turns quickly!</li>
            <li>When your caramel reaches a golden color, add the butter and condensed milk (if using) and stir until combined. Don’t worry if it bubbles up a bit—that's normal! Quickly remove from heat and immediately stir in the baking soda. It'll foam up, giving the candy a light, airy texture.</li>
            <li>While the caramel is still foamy, quickly add the roasted peanuts and a dash of salt. Stir immediately to coat the peanuts.</li>
            <li>While still hot, pour the mixture onto the prepared baking sheet. Use a greased spatula to spread it evenly before it sets. For a twist sprinkle some fresh sea salt over the top. Allow the Pé de Moleque to cool for about 15 minutes.</li>
            <li>Before your pe de moleque fully cooled, flip it onto a greased cutting board. Slice it into squares or rectangles with a sharp knife, or break it apart into bite-sized pieces. Store in an airtight container at room temperature for up to a week</li>
        </ol>
