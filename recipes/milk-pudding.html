        <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Milk</li>
            <li>Eggs</li>
            <li>Sweetened condensed milk</li>
            <li>Vanilla extract</li>
            <li>White sugar</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Step by step</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven at medium/low heat </li>
            <li>At a pudding pan, put the sugar and heat it until it melts and forms a caramel, always stirring. Do not let the sugar burn! (If your pudding pan can be used directly on the stove, use a common pan and then put the caramel on the pudding right after, before it hardens.) Set aside to cool.</li>
            <li>In the mean while, use the blender to blend together the rest of the ingredients (condensed milk, milk, eggs, vanilla essence) for about 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Put the liquid on the pudding pan, over the slightly cooled caramel.</li>
            <li>Place the pudding pan on another one with water (bain marie, a technique that prevents the sugar from overheating) and put them in the oven.</li>
            <li>Cook for something between 1:30h and 2h. It will be ready when it becomes firm, rather than liquid.</li>
            <li>Let it cool before putting in the fridge.</li>
            <li>Leave it there for around 8h before serving.</li>
            <li>If you want to serve if off the pan, use a spatule to disconnect the pudding from the pan and then turn the pan over a plate in a sudden movement.</li>
        </ol>
